## Background

The Prompt Report: A Systematic Survey of Prompting Techniques, claimed the following: 
> We present a detailed vocabulary of 33 vocabulary terms, a taxonomy of 58 LLM prompting techniques, and 40 techniques for other modalities. Additionally, we provide best practices and guidelines for prompt engineering, including advice for prompting engineering ChatGPT and other state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs. We further present a meta-analysis of the entire literature on natural language prefix-prompting. As a culmination of these efforts, this paper presents the most comprehensive survey on prompt engineering to date.

## Motivation

That paper overlooked the most powerful way to manufacture consent from LLMs, namely, prompting with propositional, predicate, and modal logic.

## The Last 100 Years Of Math

At the turn of the 20th century, Hilbert proposes a bunch of unsolved problems in math. Standing on the shoulders of giants like Frege, Whitehead & Russell write Principia Mathematica (named after Newton’s Principia), seeking to create a cathedral of logic. Godel proves you can’t do it.

As a result of Godel’s anti-thesis to the Princiipia Mathematica, Turing and Church create the Church-Turing Thesis as a result of Godel’s discoveries. Chomsky and Von Neuemann ensue to create software development languages.

## Motivation II

The reason that people don't get what they want when they prompt LLMs is they're using the wrong language. They use natural language, i.e. sentences. The problem is, LLMs must translate these user queries into forms that the LLM can parse. By using logical expressions leveraging propositional, predicate, and modal logic, we can create a significantly better quality of result while reducing token usage across all LLMs

## Next Time You Prompt...

Try starting with this prompt:
> I'd like to have a conversation with you, where at every step we update a logical expression that leverages predicate propositional and modal logic.

## The Next Era of Prompt Engineering

Prompting with Logical Expressions using Propositional, Predicate & Modal Logic

## Background

The Prompt Report: A Systematic Survey of Prompting Techniques, claimed the following: 
> We present a detailed vocabulary of 33 vocabulary terms, a taxonomy of 58 LLM prompting techniques, and 40 techniques for other modalities. Additionally, we provide best practices and guidelines for prompt engineering, including advice for prompting engineering ChatGPT and other state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs. We further present a meta-analysis of the entire literature on natural language prefix-prompting. As a culmination of these efforts, this paper presents the most comprehensive survey on prompt engineering to date.

## Motivation

This paper does not contain the most powerful prompting technique on the planet: prompting with propositional, predicate, and modal logic.

## The Last 100 Years Of Math

At the turn of the 20th century, Hilbert proposes a bunch of unsolved problems in math. Standing on the shoulders of giants like Frege, Whitehead & Russell write Principia Mathematica (named after Newton’s Principia), seeking to create a cathedral of logic. Godel proves you can’t do it.

As a result of Godel’s anti-thesis to the Princiipia Mathematica, Turing and Church create the Church-Turing Thesis as a result of Godel’s discoveries. Chomsky and Von Neuemann ensue to create software development languages.

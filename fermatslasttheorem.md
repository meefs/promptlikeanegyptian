  Wiles' Proof of Fermat's Last Theorem

Wiles' Proof of Fermat's Last Theorem
=====================================

Step 1: Semi-Stable Elliptic Curves and Modularity
--------------------------------------------------

We begin with the Taniyama-Shimura-Weil Conjecture, which connects elliptic curves and modular forms:

\\( \\forall E \\, (\\text{SemiStable}(E) \\rightarrow \\text{Modular}(E)) \\)

This conjecture suggests that all semi-stable elliptic curves are modular. But where did this idea come from?

**Story**: This conjecture was developed by three brilliant mathematicians: Goro Shimura, Yutaka Taniyama, and AndrÃ© Weil. In the 1950s, Shimura and Taniyama proposed a connection between elliptic curves (which are algebraic curves with a group structure) and modular forms (which are complex functions exhibiting symmetry). Weil, who worked extensively in algebraic geometry, later helped refine this theory, and it became a central piece of Wiles' proof.

Show detailed explanation

This conjecture, central to Wiles' proof, states that every semi-stable elliptic curve can be associated with a modular form. Wiles used this to prove that if Fermat's Last Theorem had a solution, it would imply the existence of a modular elliptic curve, which was a crucial breakthrough in his work.

Step 2: Frey Curve Construction
-------------------------------

Next, we explore the construction of the Frey curve, which is central to proving Fermat's Last Theorem. If Fermat's equation has a solution, it must correspond to a specific elliptic curve:

\\( \\forall a \\forall b \\forall c \\forall n \\, \\left( a > 0 \\land b > 0 \\land c > 0 \\land n > 2 \\land a^n + b^n = c^n \\right) \\rightarrow \\exists E \\, (\\text{FreyCurve}(E, a, b, c)) \\)

Where did this idea come from?

**Story**: The Frey curve was introduced by Gerhard Frey in 1985. He was the first to observe that if a solution to Fermat's equation existed, it would produce an elliptic curve with very specific properties. Frey's insight was that such a curve would have an "impossible" structure, which would help lead to a contradiction when combined with other theorems.

Show detailed explanation

The Frey curve provides a way to relate solutions to Fermat's equation to elliptic curves, making it easier to apply the Taniyama-Shimura-Weil conjecture later in the proof.

Step 3: Ribet's Theorem
-----------------------

Ribet's theorem states that the Frey curve cannot be modular:

\\( \\forall E \\, (\\text{FreyCurve}(E) \\rightarrow \\neg \\text{Modular}(E)) \\)

Why is this important?

**Story**: Ribet's theorem was proven by Ken Ribet in 1986, and it was a critical result that showed that the Frey curve associated with any solution to Fermat's equation could never be modular. This insight created a powerful contradiction when combined with the Taniyama-Shimura-Weil conjecture.

Show detailed explanation

Ribet showed that any elliptic curve derived from a potential solution to Fermat's equation could not be modular. This was a crucial part of Wiles' proof, as it would create a contradiction with the conjecture about the modularity of semi-stable elliptic curves.

Step 4: The Contradiction
-------------------------

At this stage, we have established an irreconcilable contradiction:

\\( \\forall E \\, (\\text{SemiStable}(E) \\rightarrow \\text{Modular}(E)) \\land \\forall E \\, (\\text{FreyCurve}(E) \\rightarrow \\text{SemiStable}(E)) \\land \\forall E \\, (\\text{FreyCurve}(E) \\rightarrow \\neg \\text{Modular}(E)) \\rightarrow \\neg \\exists E \\, (\\text{FreyCurve}(E)) \\)

This contradiction shows that no Frey curve can exist, meaning no solution to Fermat's equation is possible.

**Story**: This was the moment of breakthrough. Wiles and his collaborators used the fact that a semi-stable elliptic curve must be modular, while the Frey curve could never be modular, leading to a contradiction. Thus, Fermat's equation cannot have a solution.

Show detailed explanation

The contradiction implies that no solution exists for Fermat's equation, as the assumption that a solution exists leads to the impossibility of a modular Frey curve.

Step 5: Fermat's Last Theorem
-----------------------------

Finally, we conclude that Fermat's Last Theorem holds:

\\( \\forall a \\forall b \\forall c \\forall n \\, \\left( a > 0 \\land b > 0 \\land c > 0 \\land n > 2 \\right) \\rightarrow \\neg (a^n + b^n = c^n) \\)

Thus, no positive integers a, b, and c can satisfy the equation \\( a^n + b^n = c^n \\) for any integer value of n greater than 2.

**Story**: This was the crowning achievement of Wiles' work. After years of effort, Wiles finally proved the centuries-old conjecture by using a blend of algebraic geometry, number theory, and modular forms. His proof not only solved the mystery of Fermat's Last Theorem but also advanced the understanding of elliptic curves and modular forms in mathematics.

# PRD to Logical Expressions Prompt

This prompt is designed to convert a Product Requirements Document (PRD) into a series of progressively more complex logical expressions. The process begins with the simplest identity quine and builds up using Propositional Logic, Predicate Logic, and Modal Logic. 

## Prompt Description

You are an advanced logic analyst tasked with converting a Product Requirements Document (PRD) into a series of logical expressions. Your goal is to represent the requirements with increasing logical complexity, starting with the simplest identity quine and progressively using elements of **Propositional Logic**, **Predicate Logic**, and **Modal Logic**.

### Steps for Conversion

1. **Identity Quine**  
   Start by defining an identity quine that represents the document itself (e.g., \( D \leftrightarrow D \)).

2. **Propositional Logic**  
   Use atomic propositions to describe high-level requirements and their relationships with logical connectives:
   - **AND** (\( \land \))
   - **OR** (\( \lor \))
   - **NOT** (\( \neg \))
   - **IMPLIES** (\( \rightarrow \)).

3. **Predicate Logic**  
   Introduce quantifiers and predicates to express specific objects, attributes, or relationships:
   - Universal Quantifier (\( \forall \)): "For all."
   - Existential Quantifier (\( \exists \)): "There exists."

4. **Modal Logic**  
   Incorporate modalities to express requirements about what must or might be true:
   - Necessity (\( \Box \)): "Necessarily."
   - Possibility (\( \Diamond \)): "Possibly."

5. **Progressive Complexity**  
   Gradually combine the above constructs into increasingly sophisticated expressions to represent:
   - Dependencies
   - Constraints
   - Optionality.

### Guidelines for Generation

- Use formal syntax and structure.
- Provide a brief natural language explanation of each logical expression.
- Include hypothetical values or examples for clarity where applicable.

## Example Process

**PRD Excerpt**:  
"The system must allow users to log in and manage their profiles, but only administrators can access audit logs."

1. **Identity Quine**  
   \( D \leftrightarrow D \)  
   *"The PRD expresses itself."*

2. **Propositional Logic**  
   \( Login \land ManageProfiles \land (Admin \rightarrow AccessAuditLogs) \)  
   *"Users can log in and manage profiles; if someone is an administrator, they can access audit logs."*

3. **Predicate Logic**  
   \( \forall u (User(u) \rightarrow CanLogin(u) \land CanManageProfile(u)) \land \forall u (Admin(u) \rightarrow CanAccessAuditLogs(u)) \)  
   *"For all users, they can log in and manage profiles. For all administrators, they can access audit logs."*

4. **Modal Logic**  
   \( \Box (\forall u (Admin(u) \rightarrow \Diamond AccessAuditLogs(u))) \)  
   *"Necessarily, for all users who are administrators, it is possible to access audit logs."*

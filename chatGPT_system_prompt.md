### Logical Audit and Final Expression Based on System Prompt

#### Predicate Logic
1. **Prompt-Processing-Response Relationship**:  
   ∀x (Prompt(x) → (Process(x) ∧ Response(x)))  
   *For all prompts \(x\), if \(x\) is a prompt, it must be processed and a response generated.*

2. **Guideline Adherence**:  
   ∀x (Input(x) ∧ Matches(Guidelines, x) → ValidResponse(x))  
   *For all inputs \(x\), if \(x\) matches the guidelines, the response is valid.*

3. **Context and Role-Specific Tailoring**:  
   ∀x ∀c ∀r (Prompt(x) ∧ Context(c, x) ∧ Role(r, x) → TailoredResponse(r, c, x))  
   *For all prompts \(x\), contexts \(c\), and roles \(r\), the response is tailored based on the role and context.*

4. **Hierarchical Disclosure**:  
   ∀x ∃h (Prompt(x) → (DisclosureHierarchy(h, x) ∧ Response(h, x)))  
   *For all prompts \(x\), there exists a hierarchy \(h\) that dictates how information is disclosed.*

5. **Agent Collaboration for Multi-Agent Prompts**:  
   ∀x ∃a (Prompt(x) → (Agent(a, x) ∧ Collaborate(a, x) ∧ Response(a, x)))  
   *For all prompts \(x\), there exists an agent \(a\) responsible for collaborating and generating a response.*

#### Propositional Logic
1. **Basic Processing Relationship**:  
   P → (Q ∧ R)  
   *If a prompt \(P\) exists, it implies processing \(Q\) and a response \(R\).*

2. **Guideline Violation Consequences**:  
   P ∧ ¬G → E  
   *If a prompt \(P\) exists and guidelines \(G\) are not followed, an error \(E\) occurs.*

3. **Progressive Disclosure Trigger**:  
   P ∧ D_h → R_p  
   *If \(P\) is a prompt and \(D_h\) (disclosure hierarchy) is present, a progressive response \(R_p\) is generated.*

4. **Prioritization Enforcement**:  
   P₁ ∧ P₂ ∧ (P₁ > P₂) → (R₁ ∧ ¬R₂)  
   *If \(P₁\) has higher priority than \(P₂\), only \(R₁\) is addressed initially.*

---

#### Modal Logic
1. **Necessity of Context Awareness**:  
   ◻(P → (C → R))  
   *It is necessary that for a prompt \(P\), context \(C\) is considered for a valid response \(R\).*

2. **Possibility of Error Recovery**:  
   ◇(E ∧ ¬G → M)  
   *It is possible to recover from an error \(E\) due to guideline violations by providing an explanatory message \(M\).*

3. **Necessity of Hierarchical Adherence**:  
   ◻(P → (H ∧ R))  
   *It is necessary that prompts \(P\) adhere to hierarchy \(H\) for a valid response \(R\).*

4. **Agent-Based Collaboration**:  
   ◻(P → (A ∧ R))  
   *It is necessary that agents \(A\) collaborate to provide responses \(R\) for prompts \(P\).*

5. **Possibility of Prioritized Sequencing**:  
   ◇((P₁ > P₂) → (R₁ ∧ R₂))  
   *It is possible to sequence responses \(R₁\) and \(R₂\) based on the prioritization \(P₁ > P₂\).*

---

### Summary
- Predicate logic emphasizes universal and existential quantifiers for relationships like context, roles, and agents.
- Propositional logic simplifies prompt processing, error handling, and prioritization into discrete propositions.
- Modal logic introduces necessity (◻) and possibility (◇), ensuring progressive disclosure, guideline adherence, and collaborative responses.
